# Making The Most of R 

## Overview

This tutorial will provide an overview of using R for complex data management and Data Science tasks and deal with a lot of the setup required to take on bigger projects. I will be making use of RStudio and Github in this tutorial as they provide a lot of useful features and will generally save you time. The overall aporach I have found to work best for large scale, complex, Data Science projects is to use R as the command center, or the glue that holds all the pieces together. R is a good choice for the user facing side of the project because:

* R provides lots of helpful functions and libraries for data management.
* A number of other languages can be easily controlled from, and integrated into R programs (e.g. Bash, C++, Python)
* It is relatively easy to redistribute and extend the code you write for one project by bundling it into a package.
* R provides a nice set of tools for further data analysis and visualization when you have completed data management.
* R projects scale reasonably well -- they make sense on your laptop, but can also run on a cluster without too much trouble.

There will, however, be some applications where R is not the best choice:

* If your project requires a heavy use of natural language processing (NLP), Python offers the best libraries for doing this and may be simpler and easier to use.
* If you will be working with extremely large scale scientific simulations, you should be working directly with a more efficient language such as C, Fortran or C++ (although these can be integrated with R for most projects).
* If you need to do lots of in-memory manipulation of very large datasets (think 10-100+GB on disk), you may want to use a more memory efficient language for everythng.

These tend to be special cases of Data Science tasks, but if you think a project will require some of the above, you are either -- (a) A computer scientist who should not have trouble switching over to some other language, or (b) An ambitious social scientist who should probably go find a computer science collaborator so you do not waste your time on engineering that will not be useful to your career. I have been using the term **Data Science** in this tutorial, but so far I have not defined what I mean by the term, which is what I will do next!

### What is Data Science?

Data Science is a term that gets thrown around a lot in the media these days, it is certainly a hot field even if nobody really knows exactly what it is.
