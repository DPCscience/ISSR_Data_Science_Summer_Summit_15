## Overview



## Regular Expressions

[Regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are a way of specifying rules that describe a class of strings (for example -- every word that starts with the letter "a") that are more succinct and general than simply specifying a dictionary and checking against every possible value that meets some rule. You can start by checking out this link to an [overview of regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html), and then take a look at this primer on [using regular expressions in R](http://www.regular-expressions.info/rlanguage.html). What is important to understand is that they can be far more powerful than simple string matching.
