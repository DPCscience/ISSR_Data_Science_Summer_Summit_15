# ISSR Data Science Summer Summit 2015

## Overview

This Git repo contains all materials necessary for the ISSR Summer Summit Data Science Workshop. You can email me at <consultantmd@issr.umass.edu> or <matthewjdenny@gmail.com> with any questions. There are lots of materials available on my website at: <http://www.mjdenny.com/teaching.html>. To download the materials you see here, you will want to start by downloading a GUI client for Git. 

* For Windows: <https://windows.github.com/>
* For Mac: <https://mac.github.com/>
* For Linux, you may have to rely on the command line, although <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis> has some options (depending on your distro).

You will then want to `clone` this repo onto your computer using either the 

    https://github.com/matthewjdenny/ISSR_Data_Science_Summer_Summit_15.git

link and your client or by clicking the "Clone in Desktop" button on the right hand side of the page. If you want to directly edit the files posted here and track your changes, you can copy individual files into another directory and create your own repo with the files in it.  

## Schedule

This is a draft outline of the workshop schedule, it will likely change over the course of the workshop depending on how fast we end up going.

### Before the workshop

Please check out the Intro and Intermediate R workshops on my webiste (<http://www.mjdenny.com/teaching.html>) at the very least. We will be going over most of these materials (although quickly) on the first day, but the more you have already absorbed the more we can cover!

### Monday

1. **9:00-11:00** we will go over high level materials including setting up RStudio and Github, the structure of the workshop and a number of other useful programming tricks. We will also spend some time on internet resources.
