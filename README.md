# ISSR_Data_Science_Summer_Summit_15

## Overview

This Git repo contains all materials necessary for the ISSR Summer Summit Data Science Workshop. You can email me at <consultantmd@issr.umass.edu> or <matthewjdenny@gmail.com> with any questions. There are lots of materials available on my website at: <http://www.mjdenny.com/teaching.html>. To download the materials you see here, you will want to start by downloading a GUI client for Git. 

* For Windows: <https://windows.github.com/>
* For Mac: <https://mac.github.com/>
* For Linux, you may have to rely on the command line, although <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis> has some options (depending on your distro).

You will then want to `clone` this repo onto your computer.
